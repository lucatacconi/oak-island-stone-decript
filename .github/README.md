## Oak Island mistery

![Oak Island](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9921890/225240434-ab2da47a-e858-43d1-8742-242f97bbcf93.jpg)

For those who don't know anything about **Oak Island**, legend tell us that a deep well was dug on the island and that a great treasure was buried there. The story of the well has its roots in stories that trace the first excavation attempts back to 1795, when the young **Daniel McGinnis** (1777-1862), while walking, was intrigued by a depression in the ground located near an old oak tree, among the branches of which a hoist stood out, a sort of pulley also used on ships.

The next day Daniel, in the company of two friends familiar with ancient local legends about pirates and hidden treasures, began the excavations. But they soon realized that that depression hid a very particular well. Going deeper, every three meters they found a platform of oak wood planks but, having reached the third layer, they were forced to abandon the enterprise, which was too difficult for them. Thus was born the legend of Oak Island. That well took the name of Money Pit, the well of money.


In 1802, a private company, the **Onslow Company**, giving credence to the story of Daniel McGinnis and his companions, resumed excavations. Some layers of charcoal and clay were found but, above all, coconut fibers, which were certainly not local, because the coconut palm does not grow in Canada.

At 90 feet down the morale of the men skyrocketed. They found themselves in front of a huge stone slab that bore indecipherable engravings. It was already night when, probing the ground below with one foot, they felt something resistant. It is said that it was a possible treasure chest, or another slab.

The exhausted workers decided to postpone the discovery until the next day, but a nasty surprise awaited them. During the night the water from the Atlantic had completely flooded the well, and attempts to empty it were in vain: the water level remained constant. It was as if, in order to empty the well, the whole ocean had to be emptied. In fact, there is said to be a conduit of pipes starting under Smith's Cove; when the tide rises the conduit carries water into the Money Pit.

Over the years, about another hundred attempts have been made, which still continue today, also becoming a TV series, where the **Lagina brothers** try to dispel the veil of mystery that hides the island's secrets. However, there is still no trace of the treasure.
